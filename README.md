# Doomsday Trainer
A web-based tool to practice calculating the weekdays of arbitrary dates in your head using the [Doomsday Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_rule) invented by [John Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway).

It can be run in a browser with Javascript enabled (tested only with Firefox): [timsteinke.github.io/doomsday-trainer](https://timsteinke.github.io/doomsday-trainer/)

## TODO
The tool is a work in progress, here are some features that are missing:
- Add hotkeys (e.g. press space bar once for a new date, then again to reveal the day of the week)
- A timer that shows how long the calculation took
- A button to enter the calculated day and a display if it was right
- Statistics that tell the accuracy and average required time
- For each date, generate a detailed description of how the doomsday method works with intermediate results. Maybe also allow the user to select which variation of the algorithm they are using.
